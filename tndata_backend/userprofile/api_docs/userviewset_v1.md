## Creating a User <a href="#creating-a-user">&para;</a>

POST to `/api/users/` with the following information:

    {
        "email": "YOUR-EMAIL",
        "password": "YOUR-PASSWORD",
        "first_name": "First",
        "last_name": "Last"
    }

**Note**: `email` and `password` are required! However, `first_name` and
`last_name` are optional.

*Valid Example*:

    {
        "email": "YOUR-EMAIL",
        "password": "YOUR-PASSWORD",
    }


The response includes the created user's info, such as their database id
and the id for their created User Profile *as well as* an Auth Token for
subsequent API requests.

## Acquiring an Auth token <a href="#acquiring-an-auth-token">&para;</a>

POST to `/api/auth/token/` with either an  email/password pair:

    {"email": "YOUR-EMAIL", "password": "YOUR-PASSWORD"}


The response will contain a `token` attribute, which you can then include
with subsequent requests. Include the token in an `Authorization` HTTP
header, where the token is prefixed by the string, "Token", e.g.:

    Authorization: Token <token-value-here>

You can use curl to test authenticated reqeusts, e.g.:

    curl -X GET http://app.tndata.org/api/users/ -H 'Authorization: Token <YOUR-TOKEN>'

## Logging out <a href="#logging-out">&para;</a>

A client of the api can log out of the api by sending a POST request to
`/api/auth/logout/`. Include additional details in that request to trigger
side effects (e.g. POST a `{registration_id: 'YOUR-REGISTRATION-ID'}` payload
to remove your device's GCM registration on logout.

## Retrieving a User's Info <a href="#retrieving-a-users-info">&para;</a>

Send a GET request to `/api/users/` or to `/api/users/{id}/`.
This should include a single result set that contains the authenticated user.

## Setting a Password <a href="#setting-a-password">&para;</a>

Send a PUT request to `/api/users/{id}/` including at least the following:

    {'username': <their username>, 'password': <new password>}

## Options <a href="#options">&para;</a>

See the *Options* on this page for more information regarding which fields
are required (during PUT requests).
