## Adding a Goal

To associate a Goal with a User, POST to `/api/users/goals/` with the
following data:

    {'goal': GOAL_ID}

## Adding multiple Goals in one request

This endpoint also allows you to associate multiple goals with a user
in a single request. To do this, POST an array of goal IDs, e.g.:

    [
        {'goal': 3},
        {'goal': 4},
        {'goal': 5}
    ]

## Removing multiple Goals in one request.

This endpoint also allows you to remove  multiple instances of the
user-to-goal association. Tod do this, send a DELETE request with
an array of `usergoal` IDs, e.g.:

    [
        {'usergoal': 3},
        {'usergoal': 4},
        {'usergoal': 5}
    ]

## Viewing the Goal data

Additional information for the Goal mapping is available at
`/api/users/goals/{usergoal_id}/`. In this case, `{usergoal_id}` is the
database id for the mapping between a user and a goal.

## Removing a Goal from the user's list.

Send a DELETE request to the usergoal mapping endpoint:
`/api/users/goals/{usergoal_id}/`.

## Update a Goal Mapping.

Updating a goal mapping is currently not supported.

## Additional information

The Goals that a User has selected are also available through the
`/api/users/` endpoint as a `goals` object on the user.

Each results object also includes a `user_categories` object in addition to
a `goal` object. The `user_categories` object is a list of Categories in
which the goal belongs that have also been selected by the User. Related:
[/api/users/categories/](/api/users/categories/).
