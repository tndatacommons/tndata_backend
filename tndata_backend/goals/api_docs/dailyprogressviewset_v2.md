## Additional endpoints

There are a few additional API endpoints that you can use to work with
`DailyProgress` data for a user. These include:


### Latest DailyProgress

You can always get the latest values from [/api/users/progress/latest/](/api/users/progress/latest/).

### Daily Check-in

To update a user's daily check-in values for a goal, send a POST request
to `/api/users/progress/checkin/` with the following data:

    {
        'goal': GOAL_ID,
        'daily_checkin': <integer>,
    }

This endpoint will either return a error message when things go wrong, or
will return a serialized version of the `DailyProgress` object.

### Streaks

Retrieve a list of (recent) days in which a user _completed_ an action or
custom action. You can retrieve a user's streaks from `/api/users/progress/streaks/`.

Results will include a list of `["date", int]` values that tells you how many
times the user positively interacted with the app on a particular date (i.e.
self-reported "got it" on some action).

    {
        "count": 30,
        "results": [
            {
                "date": "2016-05-18",
                "day": "Wednesday",
                "count": 4
            },
            {
                "date": "2016-05-19",
                "day": "Thursday",
                "count": 2
            },
            ...
        ]
    }
