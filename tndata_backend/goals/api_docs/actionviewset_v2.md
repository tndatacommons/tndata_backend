**API Version 2**

An Action is something that an person can _do_. Each Action object contains
the following:

* `id`: The unique database identifier for the action
* `sequence_order`: The order in which actions should be displayed/performed (if any)
* `title`: A unique, Formal title. Use this to refer to this item.
* `description`: A short description of the Action. Plain text
  (possibly markdown)
* `html_description`: HTML version of the description.
* `more_info`: Additional information displayed when the user drills down
  into the content. Contains markdown.
* `html_more_info`: HTML version of the `more_info` field.
* `external_resource`: A link or reference to an outside resource necessary
  for adoption
* `external_resource_name`: A human-friendly name for the external resource
* `default_trigger`: An object representing a trigger/reminder for this action.
  See the [Trigger](/api/triggers/) endpoint for more details. The time included
  in this trigger contains no timezone information, so it's safe to assume
  it's always in the user's local time.
* `notification_text`: Text of the message delivered through notifications
* `icon_url`: A URL for an icon associated with the category
* `object_type`: A string that will always be `action`

## Action Endpoints

Each item is available at an endpoint based on it's database ID: `/api/actions/{id}/`.

## Filtering

Actions can be filtered using a querystring parameter. Currently,
filtering is availble for goals and categories. You can filter
by an ID or a slug.

* Retrieve all Actions that belong to a particular goal:
  `/api/actions/?goal={goal_id}`, or by slug:
  `/api/actions/?goal={goal_title_slug}`
* Retrieve all Actions that belong to a particular category:
  `/api/actions/?category={category_id}`, or by slug:
  `/api/actions/?category={category_title_slug}`
