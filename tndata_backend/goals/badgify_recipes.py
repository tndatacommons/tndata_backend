"""
Badgify Recipes.

See: https://github.com/ulule/django-badgify

----

IMPLEMENTATION

1. _X_ Create recipes as part of the goals app.
2. _X_ Listen for signals (Award.post_save?) and send a push notification when
       a user is awarded a badge. (wrap this in a waffle.switch)
3. _X_ New app (badge_api?) that exposes a user's awarded badges
4. _X_ Cron jobs that will run the badgify_sync commands to do awards

----

WORKFLOW

Typical workflow for best performances:

    $ python manage.py badgify_sync badges  # Creates badges from recipes
    $ python manage.py badgify_sync counts  # Denorm. counts (for performance)

# This one awards the badges, we need to run it more frequently, but we may
# also need the signals (which will make it slower)


----

CRON runs this command, but if you need to award badges manually, you can do
so with:

    $ python manage.py badgify_sync awards

or with this version (which won't fire any signals)

    $ python manage.py badgify_sync awards --disable-signals

----

UPDATING BADGE IMAGES

If we need to update badge images, perform the following steps:

1. run collectstatic (part of deployment)
2. run badgify_sync badges --update


----

NOTE on Recipes; A recipe class must implement:

- name class attribute -- The badge name (humanized).
- image property -- The badge image/logo as a file object.

Optionally, A recipe class may implement:

- slug class attribute
    The badge slug (used internally and in URLs). If not provided, it
    will be auto-generated based on the badge name.
- description class attribute
    The badge description (short). It not provided, value will be blank.
- user_ids property
    QuerySet returning User IDs likely to be awarded. You must return a
    QuerySet and not just a Python list or tuple. You can use
    values_list('id', flat=True).
- db_read class attribute
    The database alias on which to perform read queries. Defaults to
    django.db.DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS.
- batch_size class attribute
    How many Award objects to create at once. Defaults to
    BADGIFY_BATCH_SIZE (500).
